# Call by Color 36 – Made for iPhone

This app brings the speed dial key to the iPhones. Get direct access to your most important phone numbers. 
Call your friends and your family members with a single touch - you don't have to search the address book any more.
Three beautiful designed screens – each with 12 large buttons – can store 36 phone numbers. 
For better legibility the fontsize can be adjusted. 

This app is for everyone who wants fast access to a few frequently used phone numbers without scrolling through the long list of contacts in the address book.
Each button has a unique color and stores one phone number. You can use any name on the button – even nick names. 
Or simply copy the name and the number from the address book.

Easy to use:
* 12 large buttons per screen
* tap a button to start a phone call
* three screens for up to 36 phone numbers
* adjust the font size for better legibility
* use individual nicknames
* tap and hold (or double-tap) for editing a button
* no ads

Privacy: the phone numbers and names are exclusively stored on your iPhone. This app doesn't track you.
